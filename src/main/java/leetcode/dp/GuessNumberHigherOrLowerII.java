/*
 * LEETCODE 375
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: I pick a number from 1 to n. 
 * You have to guess which number I picked. Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you 
 * whether the number I picked is higher or lower. However, when you guess a particular 
 * number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 * Example: n = 10, I pick 8.
 * First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 * Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 * Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 * Game over. 8 is the number I picked. You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
 * 
 * Company: Google
 * Difficulty: medium
