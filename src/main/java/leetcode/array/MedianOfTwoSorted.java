 * Median: In probability theory and statistics, a median is described as the number separating the higher half of a sample, 
 * a population, or a probability distribution, from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by 
 * arranging all the numbers from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one.
