 * reservoir[0..k-1] and copy first k items of stream[] to it. 2) Now one by one
 * consider all items from (k+1)th item to nth item. a) Generate a random number

 * random number is j. b) If j is in range 0 to k-1, replace reservoir[j] with

 * a singly linked list [1,2,3]. ListNode head = new ListNode(1); head.next =
 * new ListNode(2); head.next.next = new ListNode(3); Solution solution = new

     * Suppose we see a sequence of items, one at a time. We want to keep a
     * single item in memory, and we want it to be selected at random from the
     * sequence. If we know the total number of items (n), then the solution is
     * easy: select an index i between 1 and n with equal probability, and keep
     * the i-th element. The problem is that we do not always know n in advance.
     * A possible solution is the following: Keep the first item in memory. When
     * the i-th item arrives (for i > 1): - with probability 1 / i, keep the new
     * item (discard the old one) - with probability 1 âˆ’ 1 / i, keep the old
     * item (ignore the new one) So: - when there is only one item, it is kept
     * with probability 1; - when there are 2 items, each of them is kept with
     * probability 1/2; - when there are 3 items, the third item is kept with
     * probability 1/3, and each of the previous 2 items are also kept with
     * probability (1/2)(1-1/3) = (1/2)(2/3) = 1/3; - by induction, it is easy
     * to prove that when there are n items, each item is kept with probability
     * 1/n.
