/*
 * Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. 
 * You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
 * Note: The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.
 * Example:
 * int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
 * Solution solution = new Solution(nums);
 * 
 * // pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
 * solution.pick(3);
 * 
 * // pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
 * solution.pick(1);
 * 
 * Company: Facebook
 * Difficulty: medium

	 * Keep the first item in memory.
	 * When the i-th item arrives (for i > 1):
	 * - with probability 1 / i, keep the new item (discard the old one)
	 * - with probability 1 âˆ’ 1 / i, keep the old item (ignore the new one)
	 * So:
	 * - when there is only one item, it is kept with probability 1;
	 * - when there are 2 items, each of them is kept with probability 1/2;
	 * - when there are 3 items, the third item is kept with probability 1/3, and each of the previous 2 items are also kept 
	 * with probability (1/2)(1-1/3) = (1/2)(2/3) = 1/3;
	 * - by induction, it is easy to prove that when there are n items, each item is kept with probability 1/n.
