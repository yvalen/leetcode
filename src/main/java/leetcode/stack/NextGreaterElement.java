     * You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where
     * nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers
     * for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2. The Next
     * Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its
     * right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number. Example
     * 1: Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. Output: [-1,3,-1]
     * Explanation: - For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next
     * greater number for it in the second array, so output -1. - For number 1
     * in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is
     * 3. - For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for
     * it in the second array, so output -1.
     * 
     * Example 2: Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. Output: [3,-1]
     * Explanation - For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number
     * for it in the second array is 3. - For number 4 in the first array, there
     * is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1. Note:
     * - All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique. - The length of both nums1
     * and nums2 would not exceed 1000.
